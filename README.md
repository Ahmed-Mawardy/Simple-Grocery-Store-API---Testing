*   Sending requests to different API endpoints.
*   Validating responses with robust test cases to ensure:
    *   **Status codes** are as expected.
    *   **Response times** meet performance benchmarks.
    *   **Response body** includes the correct data.
    *   **Returned data** is consistent and accurate.
*   Ensuring proper **authentication** and **authorization** mechanisms.
*   Verifying the API's **response schema** against predefined standards.\
